How to use:
- edit the `go.sh` code to supply your name, and image file names (0, 1, or 2)
- make

The hardware I used for this project:

- Raspberry Pi Zero-W
- MicroSD (I used 32GB, but 8GB should be plenty)
- [2.8 inch touch screen designed for Pi Zero](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H8ZY89H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
